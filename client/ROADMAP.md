# Roadmap

This extension is an early work-in-progress. As such, there is much left to be done. The major milestones in our roadmap are:

## Emulator support

Developers should be able to not only write code with the aid of this extension, but to test their game on a separate tab within the editor itself. This will open up the door to several more advanced development features.

## Debugger support

Modern development concepts such as step-by-step execution, address/value watching, and stack tracing, can and should be added to the extension when running games within the editor.

## Live/hot reloading

Finally, concepts used in some development platforms such as live compiling and reloading (on save) and hot reloading (modifying the code as it runs) should make Atari VCS/6502 development iterative and more fun than ever before.
